# JavaScript Reading Homework

Chapter 1.
Knew: I knew that each zero was an exponet of 2. An example being that 42 is written as 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0. 
		       Values being 0 0 32 0 8 0 2 0 -which adds up to 42
(I have a trick for counting Binary that a friend taught me back in middle school)
Learned: I learned that apostrophes, quotation marks, and backticks all make string values out of the content in the quotations.

Chapter 2.
Knew: I knew that most times, JavaScript requires the semicolon to complete the request. On some occasions, it'll let you omit it.
Learned: I learned that bindings can be any sequence of one or more letters, and can contain numbers. It just can't START with numbers.

Chapter 3.
Knew: I knew that functions could have multiple perameters, or no perameters at all.
Learned: I learned that bindings have scopes, and scopes can look into the scopes around them.
