# haiku homework

I made the apple "Samantha" voice say "So hold this moment fast, And live and love as hard as you know how. And make this moment last, because the best of times is now", and saved it as Haiku.aiff
The quote itself is the chorus refrain to the song at the end of Jackass Number Two.
In order of steps, I located myself mapped the file to my documents folder, and then inserted the text and saved it as an .aiff file. 
I didn't really face major issues with the coding. I forgot the hyphen next to the tag, which is why it didn't run originally.
